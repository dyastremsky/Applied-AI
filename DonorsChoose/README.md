This folder contains different machine learning models applied to a Kaggle DonorsChoose dataset representing grants that received
funding. The supervised algorithms were used for finding whether a grant was likely to be funded while the unsupervised algorithms
were used for clustering and visualizing the data. Summaries of findings are at the bottoms of files.
